Students cannot choose \nto defer the MDP. \nCourse Schedule: Twelve two-hour weekly slots and five full days during the entire recess week. \nThe group-based nature of MDP makes it important that the disruptive absence of members is strongly \ndiscouraged. Attendance for all scheduled MDP activities is thus compulsory. Students who do not \nsatisfy at least 80% of the overall attendance without valid reasons (e.g. MC) will be deemed to have \nfailed MDP. Students who miss more than 50% of the scheduled MDP sessions will not be deemed to \nhave  fulfilled  the  learning  outcomes  of  MDP  and  they  will  be  required  to  re-take  MDP  in  the  next \navailable offering.
